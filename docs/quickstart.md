# Quickstart

Follow the instructions on <https://qlever.dev/qlever-control> (scroll down to
the README section). In a nutshell: There is a self-documenting command-line
tool `qlever`, which is controlled by a single configuration file, called
`Qleverfile`. For most applications, the `qlever` command-line too is all you
need to use QLever.

[See here for a complete reference to all the possible settings in a `Qleverfile`](/qleverfile/).
