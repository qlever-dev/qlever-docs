# Quickstart

Follow the instructions on https://qlever.dev/qlever-control (scroll down to
the README section). There is a command-line tool `qlever`, which is controlled
by a single configuration file, called `Qleverfile`.

[See here for a complete reference to all the possible settings in a `Qleverfile`](/docs/qleverfile/)
